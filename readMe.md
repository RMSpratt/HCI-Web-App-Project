## Overview

This is a project developed during my fourth-year of post-secondary studies. All development was done by myself, and as it stands, the applciation
is functional, but incomplete in some areas. 

This project is a Gatsby JS application designed to simulate a utility application to aid stores as part of a larger retailer chain. 
It is only comprised of client-side functionality and doesn't have a back-end. 

The website can be viewed at this link: https://hci-web-app-project.vercel.app 

**NOTE:** A username + password combination is required for viewing, see the RUNNING INSTRUCTIONS section for details.


## Requirements to Run

The package dependencies that will likely be required for this project include: gatsby, gatsby-cli, react, and react-dom.

## Running Instructions

The steps for running this code are outlined below:

1) npm i 
2) gatsby develop
3) View at localhost:8000 in the browser

Once the code is running and you've navigated to it in the browser, you will be presented with an option to sign-in. I have setup two default accounts
that you can use to view all of this application's functionality. The credentials are listed below:

Employee ID: 1
Password: admin
User Role: Management (You can view management-specific functionality)

Employee ID: 2
Password: cis*4300
User Role: Employee (You can view employee-specific functionality)

Any other employee ID does not have a set password. Entering anything in the password field will instead lead you to 'set up' an account by providing a 
custom password. The password provided must meet the strength criteria provided, but otherwise has no restrictions.

Note: If you decide to use your own employee ID in this way, the account will not be saved by the application. (If you sign out, the account will be gone).


## Limitations

Not all features are finished in the web-app, so there are some disabled options.
